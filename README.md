# Emoji's Demo

Just a dumb fun little project, a REST API that responds with emoji's based on the request.
If optional query parameters are set, the emoji being sent out might be different (depending on whether certain conditions are met in the input query parameters).

Try it out at [http://emojis-demo-v2.herokuapp.com/](the demo live link).
